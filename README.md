# UT-Mart-Sales-Analysis-Tableau

UT Discount Mart, a small supermarket owned by Mr. Utkarsh, requires a dashboard to monitor its performance this year in terms of Sales, Profit, and Quantity Sold. He is also interested in analyzing the performance of different product categories and regions.

Mr. Utkarsh suspects that most customers purchase two or more products per basket/order and would like this hypothesis verified using the data. Additionally, he noted that Profit is calculated as 30% of the selling price.

To address these requirements, we utilized the provided CSV files to create an interactive dashboard. This dashboard allows Mr. Utkarsh to easily review key metrics and toggle between various shipping statistics across different months and years, empowering him to make informed decisions for the business's growth.
